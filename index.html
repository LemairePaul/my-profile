				<h2>Presentation</h2>
				<p>My name is Paul Lemaire. I am a 17 years old French student at <strong>ESSEC Business School</strong>. Currently involved in the BBA, I love discovering new thematics, such as coding!</p>

				<h3>Basketball 🏀</h3>
				<p>I have now played basketball for almost 10 years and it is by far my favourite sport for so many different reasons. I am 6'4, which makes it easier; I lived in New York for 2 years, and closely followed the NBA for years now; Lots of my friends love basketball too, which makes it so much better. <strong>GO KNICKS !</strong></p>

				<h3>Music 🎧</h3>
				<p>I have always loved music. I listen to music every single day, and I never get bored. Discovering new songs or artists that can become your new favourite one in just a few notes is an amazing feeling. I could say that I mainly listen to rap, but I enjoy so many genres. My playlists can go from <strong>Drake</strong> to <strong>Debussy</strong> in a few seconds.</p>

				<h3>Future 🛣</h3>
				<p>Life is unpredictable, and I do not have one specific job or goal to aim for yet. But many different fields interest me. Becoming an <strong>entrepreneur</strong> by creating a company by myself or with friends would be amazing. Working in some sectors of <strong>finance</strong> is also something which I find strongly attractive, because of the possible diversification of missions. And who knows, if I keep learning on how to code, I might work in <strong>technology</strong>, which is the most promising area to work in.</p>
